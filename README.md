<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was a challenge made for a job vacancy. All hints, warnings and memory leaks should be resolved and all corrections and implementations made. That's what was done in the project:

Implementations -> exception handler with logging; progress bar; thread usage.
Fixes -> not deleting even values on Datasetloop screen; out of memory errors on ClienteServer screen.

### Built With

* [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/br/products/delphi/starter/free-download)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The only interactive part is in Threads. After typing how many threads you want to create and the time for the interactions, just click on Start and the program will show the thread identification number accompanied by the 'process started' warning. After it has done its work, the program will again display the thread ID along with a 'process terminated' warning.
